## 🧠 Overview

This repository hosts the open, reproducible materials developed as a **methodological extension of a doctoral thesis in Applied Data Science**, focused on the analysis of urban PM2.5 concentrations.

Rather than proposing a single optimal predictive model, the project introduces a **coherent analytical pipeline** designed for real-world environmental data, where temporal structure, interpretability, and reproducibility are prioritised over algorithmic benchmarking.

The project is presented as an example of **research continuity**, illustrating how a doctoral research line can evolve beyond the thesis itself.

---

## 🎯 Research motivation

Urban air quality analysis is often approached through fragmented workflows, ad hoc modelling decisions, or performance-driven comparisons that overlook methodological coherence.

This project responds to several recurrent limitations observed in applied data science practice:

- Insufficient attention to the temporal structure of environmental data.
- Overemphasis on predictive performance at the expense of interpretability.
- Superficial adoption of emerging technologies without methodological grounding.
- Limited reproducibility in applied environmental analytics.

The proposed pipeline addresses these issues by prioritising **analytical clarity, transparency, and methodological robustness**.

---

## 🧩 Reproducible methodological workflow

The analytical workflow follows a structured and sequential pipeline:

1. **Data preparation and harmonisation**  
   Validation of raw observations, temporal parsing, and explicit handling of missing values.

2. **Exploratory and structural analysis**  
   Examination of temporal dynamics, seasonal behaviour, and data gaps to understand the data-generating process.

3. **Classical modelling and evaluation**  
   Simple baseline and linear models with time-based validation to establish methodological reference points.

4. **Quantum methodological extension**  
   Integration of a quantum kernel-based model under NISQ constraints, without claims of performance superiority.

This workflow reflects a **methodological stance**, not a technology-driven comparison.

---

## 🧭 Analytical philosophy

The pipeline is guided by the following principles:

- **Sequential structure**: each analytical step builds explicitly on the previous one.
- **Time-aware validation**: no random splits are applied to temporal data.
- **Model parsimony**: simple and interpretable models are favoured where appropriate.
- **Reproducibility by design**: all results are generated programmatically from documented scripts.
- **Extensibility**: emerging analytical paradigms can be integrated without structural changes.

This philosophy underpins both the doctoral thesis and its extension presented here.

## 🔁 Reproducibility and openness

All analyses are fully reproducible and rely exclusively on open-source tools.

  - Scripts are executed sequentially and independently.
  - No manual data manipulation is performed.
  - Computational environments are explicitly documented.
  - Results are generated programmatically from source code.
  
This approach supports transparent, verifiable, and reusable research practices.

## 🎓 Relation to the doctoral thesis

This project constitutes a direct methodological extension of the doctoral thesis and is presented as evidence that the research line remains active, adaptable, and open to emerging analytical methodologies.

It is not intended as a standalone technological breakthrough, but as a **coherent continuation of a broader research programme** in applied data science and urban environmental analytics.
