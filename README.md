# Urban PM2.5 Methodology

Reproducible methodological pipeline for the analysis and modelling of urban PM2.5 daily time series, with a focus on data quality, transparency, and hybrid modelling approaches.

This repository supports an ongoing research article exploring classical, hybrid, and quantum-inspired methods for urban air quality prediction.
